Since repo is a hopeless name to google, add a link to the homepage at https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/\n\nUsing the repo tool is not a requirement. parentpom and other necessary files should be available from sonatype-nexus-snapshots so it should be possible to checkout a single project and build it.
